# MealMate App API Endpoint Tech Spec

## Overview

The MealMate app API endpoint will be developed using the Flask framework. It will integrate OpenAI API, Google Places API, and provide CRUD functionality using Supabase.

## Components

### Flask Framework

- Set up a new Flask project and structure the directories.
- Create API endpoints for OpenAI, Google Places, and CRUD operations.
- Implement error handling and authentication (if needed).

### OpenAI API

- Create an API endpoint to fetch food-related data from the OpenAI API.
- Use OpenAI's GPT-4 to generate meal suggestions and recipe ideas.
- Handle errors and rate limiting from the OpenAI API.

### Google Places API

- Create an API endpoint to fetch nearby restaurant data from the Google Places API.
- Use the Google Places API to search for restaurants based on user location and preferences.
- Handle errors and rate limiting from the Google Places API.

### Supabase CRUD Operations

- Set up a Supabase database with appropriate tables and relationships for meal and user data.
- Create API endpoints for CRUD operations on meal and user data.
- Implement validation and error handling for Supabase interactions.

## Security Considerations

- Secure API keys for OpenAI and Google Places API.
- Implement authentication and authorization to restrict access to the API endpoints.
- Use HTTPS for secure communication between the client and the API.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for each API endpoint, ensuring correct functionality and error handling.
- Perform integration tests to verify the API works as expected with the OpenAI, Google Places, and Supabase components.
- Conduct load testing to ensure the API can handle the expected traffic.

## Deployment

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- Deploy the MealMate API to a scalable and secure cloud hosting platform, such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

## Documentation

- Document API usage, including endpoint descriptions, request and response examples, and error codes.
- Provide setup and deployment instructions for developers.
